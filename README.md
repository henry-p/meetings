> Meetings suck!

Because they are not efficient.

##### Problems:
* Team members want to **have a say** regarding the agenda
  * ...but how to **organize** that?
* There is no **good** structure in meetings
* Team members don't know the structure of the meeting **beforehand**
* How to **analyze** efficiency and effectiveness?

##### Solution:
* Organize:
  * Add agenda topics beforehand
  * Let team members add and upvote agenda items
  * Assign team members to actionables
  * Create Follow Ups
  
* Analyze:
  * Time analytics
  * Actionable analytics
  * Team analytics

#### Code status
